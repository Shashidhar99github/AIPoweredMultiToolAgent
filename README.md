🤖 AI-Powered Multi-Tool Telegram Agent — Project Overview

This project is an AI-powered multi-tool assistant built using n8n that works directly inside Telegram. The workflow is triggered whenever a user sends a message to the Telegram bot. An AI Agent powered by Google Gemini understands the user's intent and decides whether to respond directly or use a specific tool to complete the task.

The assistant can perform multiple functions such as engaging in natural conversations, fetching real-time information from the web using SerpAPI, performing mathematical calculations with a calculator tool, searching information on Wikipedia, and managing calendar events using Google Calendar. It also uses a memory feature to retain conversation context and provide more natural, continuous interactions.

Once the task is completed, the AI generates a final response and sends it back to the user on Telegram. This project demonstrates how to build a smart, automated, multi-functional AI assistant that integrates various tools into a single intelligent workflow using n8n.
